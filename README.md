Exploring global trends through Rosling's lens
In Hans Rosling’s TED talk, titled The Best Stats You’ve Ever Seen, he demonstrates the movement of the world’s economy using design. As Hans rightly said, data is publicly funded and should be accessible to anyone. Statisticians argue that data needs nourishment and that if any untrained eye accesses the data as it is, they won’t demonstrate the reality. However, with tools which combine data with design, we can create a picture – A program that takes the data and creates the image for us so anyone can visualise these movements.



👉Objective
Explore the realm of data visualization in Python by utilizing powerful libraries. The task is to create visually engaging and informative plots, graphs, and charts based on a provided dataset.

📄Dataset Information
● Life expectancy at birth: The number of years a newborn would live if the patterns of mortality at the time of birth remain the same throughout his life.

● Fertility rate: Number of children a woman would give birth to during her childbearing years.

● Country population: Total number of residents regardless of legal status or citizenship.

🗂️Libraries used
NumPy Used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations.
Pandas To analyze big data, make conclusions based on statistical theories, clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Plotly Open-source module that is used for data visualization and supports various graphs like line charts, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, area plots, etc.
Matplotlib Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

There will be some differences between the original visualisation and the one that has been used:

● More data: The talk was made in 2006 with data from 1962 to 2003 and data used is from 1960 to 2016.
● Regions: The original visualisation has five regions. We will keep the regions from the source data (i.e. seven regions).
● Colours: We can't get the exact colours of the regions so use colour mapping.

Visualization
Data visualization, the art of translating data into compelling visual representations, has become an indispensable tool in data analytics. It serves as a powerful catalyst for Uncovering insights, enhancing communication and facilitating decision-making.
To start with the visualization following steps are to be performed: 1. Load Data 2. Data Overview 3. Handle Missing Values 4. Data Types 5. Merge DataFrames (If required for any visualization)
